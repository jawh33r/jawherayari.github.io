PROFILE PICTURE SETUP
====================

To add your profile picture:

1. Save your profile image as "profile.jpg" in this folder (public/)
2. Recommended specifications:
   - Format: JPG, PNG, or WebP
   - Size: 400x400px or larger (square aspect ratio works best)
   - File size: Under 500KB for optimal loading

3. The image will automatically appear on:
   - Home page (hero section)
   - About page (top section)

4. If you want to use a different filename, update the image paths in:
   - app/page.tsx (line ~20)
   - app/about/page.tsx (line ~20)

Alternative: You can also use profile.png or profile.webp
Just update the src attribute in the img tags accordingly.
